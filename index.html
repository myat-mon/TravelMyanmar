            <h2>Travel In Myanmar</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to arrive just before the rains, where there was a
                limited number of tourists and I could walk into a
                guesthouse and get a room without any problems. The only
                downside to this time of the year is that it is incredibly
                hot and I mean disgustingly, sweaty hot.

            <p>
                In our minds, we pictured travel in Myanmar to be like
                travel in other parts of Southeast Asia, but a bit less
                developed. After two weeks in the country, we were surprised
                at the current tourism infrastructure, which allowed us to
                travel freely and conveniently around the major traveler hot
                spots, and with ample amounts of English along the way.
                Traveling in Myanmar is incredibly safe, even if you are
                traveling solo. In fact, Myanmar is probably one of the
                safest places we have ever been, where crime is not even a
                topic that travelers talk about.

                <h3>Transportation</h3>
                <p>
                    We found that Grab, one of the helpful travel apps we
                    downloaded before arrival, only worked in Yangon to get
                    a fair price. When you get off the night bus, youâ€™ll
                    likely get quoted a higher-than-usual amount.

                <h3>Accommodation</h3>
                <p>
                    Accommodation ranges from the basic guesthouse to the
                    5-star Shangri-La Hotel in Yangon. We chose our
                    accommodation to be the middle of the road: new hostels
                    with modern amenities.

                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>
                    Ls mentioned, street food is pretty oily, greasy and
                    fried in Myanmar. Street food in Yangon had a bit of an
                    Indian vibe, right down to the fried samosas or breads
                    we saw being sold on the street.
